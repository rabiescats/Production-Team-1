## Game Concept
You play as a robot in a post-apocalyptic world. Your life until now has been simple, punching and cutting down trees, but seeing an intriguing sign sends you down a trail to find out who you are, why you're here, and who created you. You weren't built for battle, but you'll find a way to use your tools to punch and slash until you reach the end.
